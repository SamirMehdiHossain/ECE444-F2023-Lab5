Test-Driven Development (TDD) is when tests are written before the actual code. Some of its primary benefits include improved code quality, as it encourages developers to think about requirements and design up front. This approach often leads to cleaner, more maintainable code. Additionally, TDD instills confidence in redeveloping or iterating. Developers can make changes knowing that any disruptions will be noticed by the various unit test. Furthermore, TDD clearly outlines specifications, making it easier for both current team members and those who might join later to understand the intended functionality. However, TDD is not its cons. It can be time-consuming, particularly when developers are unfamiliar with its methodology or when dealing with changing requirements. There's also a risk of overemphasis on unit tests, potentially taking away focus from other important types of testing. While TDD can elevate the development process, a development team must ensure that they take a well-balanced approach to ensure that a project meets/exceeds the requirements.
